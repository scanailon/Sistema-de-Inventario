      this License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

2. Scope of License

   a. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby
      grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
      irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed
      Material to:

      i. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

      ii. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
      and Limitations apply to Your use, this License does not apply.

   c. Term. The term of this License is specified in Section 6(a).

   d. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
      You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
      known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary
      to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to
      exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary
      to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
      License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(d) never
      produces Adapted Material.

   e. Downstream recipients.

      i. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
         Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
         exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
         License.

      ii. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient
          of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the
          Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under
          the conditions of the license You apply to the Adapted Material.

      iii. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
           or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
           Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
           exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

3. License Conditions

   Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
   following conditions:

   a. Attribution.

      i. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
         must:

         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
            Licensed Material:

            - identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
              others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
              requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

            - a copyright notice;

            - a notice that refers to this License;

            - a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

            - a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
              practicable;

         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
            of any previous modifications; and

         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this License, and
            include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this License.

      ii. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(i) in any reasonable
          manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
          Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
          conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
          the required information.

      iii. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
           required by Section 3(a)(i)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

   b. NonCommercial. You may not use the Licensed Material for commercial purposes.

   c. ShareAlike.

      i. In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
         Material You produce, the following conditions also apply:

         A. The Adapted Material must be licensed under the terms of this License,
            or a later version of this License with the same License Elements, or
            a Compatible License.

         B. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the License
            You applied to the Adapted Material.

         C. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
            conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
            Adapted Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
            by any recipient of the Adapted Material.

4. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
      possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
      and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
      Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
      includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
      for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
      defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
      known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
      full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
      any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
      for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
      exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
      License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been
      advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.
      Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
      limitation may not apply to You.

5. Term and Termination

   a. This License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
      licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this License, then Your
      rights under this License terminate automatically.

   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
      5(a), it reinstates:

      i. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
         cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

      ii. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5(b) does not affect any right the
      Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this License.

   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
      Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
      Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
      License.

   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this License.

6. Other Terms and Conditions

   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
      conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
      Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
      and conditions of this License.

7. Interpretation

   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this License does not, and shall not be
      interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
      the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
      this License or under applicable copyright or Similar Rights law.

   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this License is deemed
      unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
      shall be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of
      the remaining terms and conditions.

   c. No term or condition of this License will be waived and no failure to
      enforce any provision of this License will constitute a waiver of that
      provision or any other provision.

   d. Nothing in this License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
      upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
      Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
      authority.
